# Cookbook (Minimal)

This application is meant to be a barebones implementation of the cookbook that includes all of the same features. It does not have any external JavaScript dependencies (even for testing!), so it is unaffected by dependency vulnerabilities or api changes.

## Environment

- Web Browser
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org) (for testing)

## Setup/Run

You will need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed if you want to run tests

Then, if you understand them, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
-- Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/nathanblaubach/cookbook.git

-- Run the web application:
-- Open any of the html files in a browser

-- Run the tests:
cd cookbook/web-minimal
./test.sh -- Note: You may need to give permission to run this script
```
