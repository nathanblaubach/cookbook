# Cookbook

## Purpose

This cookbook is a simple list of recipes for my mom's family's family cookbook, but I am writing it in a way that (I hope) is easily reusable. The recipes seen when the application is launched are currently being pulled from a JSON file. See the [React application](./ui) for more information on running the cookbook.
