# Cookbook

## Purpose

This cookbook is a simple list of recipes. I am writing the application for my mom's family's family cookbook, but I am writing it in a way that (I hope) is easily reusable. The recipes seen when the application is launched are currently being pulled from a JSON file. When a database solution is deployed, the JSON file will be removed.
