# Cookbook

## Purpose

This cookbook is a simple list of recipes. I am writing the application for my mom's family's family cookbook, but I am writing it in a way that (I hope) is easily reusable.

The recipes seen when the application is launched are currently being pulled from a JSON file in the web application. When a backend solution is deployed, the JSON file will be removed.

## Setup

You will need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed.

Then, if you understand them, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
-- Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/nathanblaubach/cookbook.git

-- Run the web application:
cd cookbook/web
npm install
npm start
```
